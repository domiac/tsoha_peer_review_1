### Peer review for olavizz

The foundations are solid but I expect more functionality into the app. The topic chooser was nice. Also remember to delete all test stuffs when you push into github to keep the repo clean. For the next review please pip freeze requerements.txt so everyone will get the same requirements into their virtual environments. I think it's a good idea to add the topic adder for admins.


Code is pretty clean. I'd separate sql, routes and app separately but that's just me. 


Good progress!
